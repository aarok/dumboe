    <p style="text-align:center">Saarihelvetti is a festival held on the island of Viikinsaari in Lake Pyhäjärvi. The normally quiet island hosts an outdoor-theatre, minigolf course and a kiosk.
    
     Only way to get there is by a ferry which runs every hour. We got on the ferry and arrived to an island full of metalheads. </p>
