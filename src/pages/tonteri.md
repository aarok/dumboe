         Roope Tonteri is one of the most motivated snowboarders in the business. When the world champion isn’t competing around the world he loves to spend time in his summer hideout. He travels two-hundred days every year but every time he straps the bindings he still has that childlike enthusiasm in his eyes. It doesn’t matter if it’s a mountain or just a backyard rail he rips the shit out of it.<br><br> We visited his secret hideout in Eastern Finland.</p>
