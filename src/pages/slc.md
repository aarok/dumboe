<p style="text-align:center">Pablo films gave us a privilege to shoot the Salt Lake City section of their new Nitro Snowboards movie called "28 Winters". On a day's notice, we packed our stuff with Elias Markkula and flew to the snowboarding mecca of the United States. Countless professional snowboarders live or have lived in Salt Lake City, Utah. Global superstars like Jeremy Jones, JP Walker and Pat Moore have provided a path for the next generation. “Youngsters” like Sam Taxwood, Benny Urban, Zak Hale and Chris Grenier are following their footsteps keeping the snowboarding community alive in Salt Lake. All the different generations from different decades get together and make  Salt Lake City snowboarding community so special.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">The movie 28 Winters tells us a story about brand called Nitro Snowboards. "28 Winters" is all about the basics. What was snowboarding like in the old days and what is it in the future.

<p style="text-align:center">Jeremy Jones is one of the most known snowboarders ever lived. He is the pioneer in urban snowboarding. Last winter in Utah backcountry something unfortunate happened. He was caught in an avalanche and swept away into trees. Jeremy broke both of his legs and almost lost his life that day. With the support of the snowboarding  community and his family the recovery went well and slowly but surely he can start doing sports again and even go snowboarding.

<p style="text-align:center">Weather changes rapidly in Salt Lake City. It’s a battle between winter and summer all the time. Two days before this photo it was snowing and we shot an urban rail two blocks away.</p>
